# Wave3AI — CIP Platform (Privacy-Preserving, Crypto-Agile, PQ-Ready)

**Wave 3 LLC (Virginia)** builds **CIP** — a **privacy-preserving (ZKP-backed)**, **crypto-agile (PQ-ready)** platform for **tamper-evident timestamping** and **deterministic secure receipts** for **healthcare** and other regulated **AI verticals**. Example downstream application: **[caring-call.com](https://caring-call.com)** (health demo powered by CIP).

- **What we offer:** Evaluation-ready artifacts and pilots for Gov/Enterprise security/compliance teams  
- **Key properties:** Privacy by design (ZKP), crypto-agility, post-quantum readiness, determinism, auditability  
- **Contact:** wave3ai@gmail.com

## Who this page is for

- **University administrators / SMU-DDI sponsors:** sponsored research, SBIR/STTR teaming  
- **Prior employer readers:** high-level overview (no proprietary details), independence statement below  
- **Corporate CISOs / procurement:** license/evaluation paths and compliance posture  
- **Treasury / BEP / GENIUS / CLARITY staff:** Government-Purpose License (proposed) with buy-up path  
- **Standards (IETF) community:** architectural direction and privacy/security goals

## CIP in 60 seconds

**Problem.** Regulated AI systems need **verifiable timing and receipts** across data, models, and actions—without leaking sensitive content.

**Solution.** **CIP** issues **tamper-evident timestamps** and **deterministic secure receipts** with **selective disclosure via ZKPs**. The stack is **crypto-agile** (swap hash/signature suites) and **PQ-ready**, supporting long-horizon compliance.

**Outcomes.**
- **Privacy-preserving** integrity proofs (no sensitive payloads revealed)  
- **Deterministic receipts** suitable for automation and audits  
- **Crypto-agile profiles** that can evolve without redesign  
- **PQ-ready** options for forward security and migration planning

---

## Evaluation & Compliance (what you can request)

- **Artifacts:** high-level architecture, **SBOM**, threat model, **SSDF-aligned SDLC** summary, `SECURITY.md`  
- **Deployment paths:** **FedRAMP Moderate ATO path** or **on-prem** lab pilot *(no endorsement implied)*  
- **Licensing (Gov):** **Proposed** Perpetual **Government-Purpose License** with **buy-up** to Unlimited Rights  
- **Licensing (Enterprise):** commercial license with escrow and maintenance options

> No FedRAMP Authorization, endorsements, or awards are implied. “ATO path” indicates alignment and readiness for evaluation—not an authorization.

## Regulatory context & alignment (for discoverability)

- **Treasury — GENIUS Act RFC (2025):** CIP’s privacy-preserving receipts and tamper-evident timestamps support **selective disclosure** and **audit trails** for illicit-finance detection.  
- **Secure Software Development (NIST SSDF):** SDLC aligns with **NIST SP 800-218**; we provide **SBOM + security.md + threat model** during evaluations.  
- **SBOM & VEX:** Following **CISA** SBOM guidance and VEX practices.  
- **Post-Quantum Migration:** **Crypto-agile** and **PQ-ready**, tracking **NIST PQC** standards (**FIPS 203/204/205**).  
- **Standards (IETF):** CIP receipts map to **SCITT** (supply chain) and **RATS** (attestation) patterns; aiming for interoperable receipt schemas and attestations.
